## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This Project is part of [Udacity Data Scientis Nanodegree Programme.](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)

1. What is the best method to build dog breed classifier ?
2. Accuracy of the model when comes to identify dog breed ?
3. If human is detected what dog breed his/her image resmble.
4. Is use of transfer learning going to imporve the model ?
5. What will be the test results of given images?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
In this repository following files included:
- dog_app.ipynb - jupyter notebook contains descriptive steps and codes 
- extract_bottleneck_features.py - Contains python based functions to extarct bottleneck features from selected model
- images Folder - this folder contains images used in jupyter notebook
- myImages Folder - this folder contains images used for test the model
